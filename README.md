Adventures of Gasin
===================

Adventures of Gasin is a tile-based role playing game (RPG) that I developed in 1998 while 
in highschool. It is one of my first programs, written entirelly in Microsoft QBasic.

Prerequisites
-------------

1. QBasic Executable (qbasic.exe) - I am pretty sure I can't distribute it, I hope you have a copy.
2. [DOSBox](http://www.dosbox.com/) - You'll need a DOS emulator to run QBasic.
